This project is used to demonstrate my ability to use Express, Node, deployment to Heroku.
## Why the project is useful
This can be helpful since new dating apps are being made all the time and figuring out how to opimize searches as well as managing databases that best fit the client's survey results.
## How users can get started with the project
You will need to launch the application through node to see if find it in the local host or through Heroku.  Upon completing the survey, your results will indicate who is your best fit for a friend.
